Transcription for: Jesse Eisenberg - Mark Zuckerberg (360p).mp4
==================================================

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.280] He's a guy who I think is really desperate to connect to other people but finds it very
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.280] difficult to.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:19.760] I think he feels alienated by traditional forms of socialization in person socialization.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.600] I think he feels uncomfortable a lot of times.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.680] And ironically in almost to cope, he creates this environment where he does feel comfortable
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.680] interacting.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.680] And that's Facebook.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.600] It's what makes him really interesting, what makes him extraordinary, I guess, is the
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.920] way he was able to take that thing that makes him feel comfortable and share it with 500
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.800] other million people who also feel comfortable.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:54.520] I think my character prioritizes Facebook.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.040] Above all else.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:03.720] So in the movie, his roommate Eduardo Savrin, who gives him $20,000 to start the company,
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.120] wants to take the company in a different direction.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.840] And I think Mark prioritizes Facebook above that personal relationship.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.760] And so it may appear as though he's not a good friend.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.080] But if you look at it as I did through his eyes, Facebook was more important than the
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.080] friendship.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:32.680] It's a perfectly defendable and honorable position if you view creative work as very important.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.760] Almost conversely when he's with Sean Parker who takes the company in the direction that
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.080] Mark wants it to go in, but then starts acting in a way that's responsible.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.880] He severes that tie as well.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.080] So I kind of view all of his actions, even if they may appear hurtful at some points,
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.080] to be entirely defendable.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.880] I've been a huge fan of Aaron Sorkins for a really long time.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.280] I really loved watching sports night.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.680] I would videotape every episode and watch the scenes over and over again because there's
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.480] so much there, the first time you watch them, they're entertaining and funny.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.880] Second time you watch them, you realize there's so much more happening and it takes the
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.800] subsequent viewings to really fully appreciate everything he's done.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.360] I don't think this movie is that different.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.800] I've seen this movie once and it's incredibly dramatic and incredibly funny.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.880] And yet I know I missed half of what was intended and I know the script intimately having worked
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.880] on it.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:50.400] And he writes very clever, fast paced dialogue, but in a way that's completely accessible
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.400] to all of us.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.080] I knew nothing about Facebook and I still appreciated the entire story.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.880] I knew nothing about computer programming and I still appreciated the story.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.520] Aaron is able to make very smart people and say very clever things that we all can kind
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.600] of understand and appreciate.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.760] This movie has an incredibly singular tone.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.080] What that means is the aesthetic, the look of it, the actual colors of it, the way it's
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.080] edited together, the pace at which it's put together, the music that's underscoring the
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:39.760] entire film is all consistent in a way that you could watch any frame of this movie and
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.560] know that it's from this movie.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.960] This is something that David Fincher does the best.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:56.880] And so in this movie that had kind of a really incredible story and really incredible characters
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:04.760] and really incredible dialogue also has an amazing and consistent aesthetic.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.320] The movie I think would have been great because Aaron's script was so fantastic without that.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:17.160] It's that much more incredible that David Fincher is just a master filmmaker, brought
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.320] this incredibly singular and just beautiful aesthetic to this movie.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.480] As meticulous as David is with his framing and with moving the microphone half a foot
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.480] away from the piano to get it kind of a different quality, he's meticulous with his actors.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.760] There's one scene where I'm speaking to the administrative board of Harvard and I'm kind
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.760] of getting reprimanded and he said, just move your head to the right.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.080] I move my head to the right a little bit.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.080] He said, no, no, that's way too much.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.080] I was like, oh, it's like an inch.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.400] As we moved it half an inch to the right.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.600] And then when we did the scene on the other angle looking over my head, he said, move your
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.200] head to the same, same to the right.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.200] And it did so much to it evoked so much from me.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.760] It evoked a kind of condescending attitude toward the administrative board, just that slight
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.760] gesture.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:23.760] And it was like that in every scene he would offer the slightest kind of transition and
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.080] it would change everything.
